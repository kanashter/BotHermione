		<h1>Thank You for Participating</h1>
		<p>
			It has truly been a joy to see everyone enjoying AO3 wrapped this year. The online servers
			will now be shut down till 2022 - when BotHermiones AO3 wrapped will return bigger, and better
			than ever.
			<br /><br />
			If you missed out on all the fun, don't despair. I'll keep the local version available for download.
			If you'd like to grab the release, it'll remain here for the year.
			<br /><br />

				href="https://github.com/kanashter/bothermione-ao3wrapped/releases/tag/v1.0.2"
				style="text-decoration: underline;">AO3 Wrapped - Local Version</a
			>
			<br /><br />
			There's been so much activity on the server, I decided to make a quick writeup. If you're interested
			in things like this, it can be found here

			>
			<br /><br />
			It's been truly wonderful sharing this little slice of joy with you all. I'll admit I didn't expect
			to see Anal Sex ðŸ¥º turn up as high as it did on peoples list, but in retrospect the method of tagging
			on AO3 always meant it was going to be a top contender.
			<br /><br />
			If you have questions about setting something like this up yourself, or would like to be a beta
			tester for v2, please do DM me on twitter. The account can be found in the sidebar.
			<br /><br />
			xoxo BotHermione
